## Project Description
For this project we are focusing on Airbnb and their housing service in Amsterdam. Throught the analysis of different sets of data we want to give a brief description of the status of their business in our city (and the evolution of this business throught a longitudinal dataset if we decide to include multiple years). We chose this project because its the only good data we got -HA!- XXXXXXXXXXXX

## Questions & Hypotheses
<!-- What are the questions you would like to answer with your analysis? What did you feel were the answers to those questions before answering them with data? -->
Our main question is: Has Airbnb housing business increased in the last year (or years, to define) or declined?  
Our Null Hypothesis is that the business has not indeed grown in the last year(s).  
Our Alternative Hypothesis is that the housing business has indeed increase in the last year(s).  
A second Alternative Hypothesis is that the housing business has decreases in the last year(s).

<!-- We cannot talk much about the quality of the service since the reviews dont have any points, its just the text :( -->
## Dataset
We used dataset from the following sources: Kaggle, Insideairbnb and directly Airbnb.
These datasets contain different information about listings, reviews, neighborhoods, calendars, etc.

## Database
Our database consists of 5 tables (so far, maybe will need update afterwards) connected between them. Of these 5 tables, 2 of them are just an extended table from their original.  
We have listings and listing_details (as mentioned before, its exactly like its mother table but with much more columns of information) which is a list of all the available listings in Amsterdam; We also have reviews and reviews_details (same case), which include all the reviews for the aforementioned listings. Last, we have calendar that lists all the dates of the year for each listing, and information like availability and price.
